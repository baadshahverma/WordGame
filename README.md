# WordGame

This program is a simple word game. The user is given two letters to start, which they
will have to take and come up with a word that starts with the first letter and
ends with the second letter. This word will be validated to see if it is in the
list of cleansed words and scored accordingly. If you enter a valid word, you will 
proceed to the next round and have the ability to "Continue" or "Exit". If invalid,
game ends and you lose.The score will be kept throughout the game.
